# Test Post for Hashnode Publishing

This is a simple test post to verify that the Hashnode publishing workflow is working correctly.

## Why This Test?

The main article is quite large and complex, which may be causing issues with the Hashnode API. This smaller test will help isolate the problem.

## Next Steps

Once we confirm this works, we can:
1. Add content incrementally
2. Test image embedding
3. Test code blocks
4. Add more complex formatting
